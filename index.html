      <p>I just want to say...</p>
      <h2>...I like you. ❤️</h2>
      <p>I like you because you're *you*, Aliya. If it weren’t you, I wouldn't feel the same way.</p>
      <p>If you’re tired of thinking in English, you can switch back to Bahasa using the button at the top. Okay, now my confession... Aliya Kamila, can we get to know each other better? To share stories, support each other, solve problems together — whether personal or between us. To hang out, talk about anything, important or not.
        I believe we could be great partners and motivate each other. Al, I know I'm not perfect. I'm not handsome, and I'm only 160 cm tall. I’m just a simple guy, but I’ll try my best for you, Al 😌</p>
      <p>Please answer me, Aliya. Whatever your answer is, I’ll accept it. I won’t force you if you don’t feel the same way.</p>
      <p>Thank you, Aliya, for reading this and giving attention to a freak like me, hehe..</p>
